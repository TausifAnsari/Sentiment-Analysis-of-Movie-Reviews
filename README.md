# Movie Review Classification
# Introduction:
>Movie	reviews	are	an	important	way	to	gauge	the	performance	of	a	movie.		While	providing	a	
numerical/stars	rating	to	a	movie	tells us	about	the	success	or failure	of	a	movie	quantitatively,	
a	collection	of	movie	reviews	is	what	gives	us	a	deeper	qualitative	insight	on	different	aspects	of	
the movie.	A	textual	movie	review	tells	us	about	the	the	strong	and	weak	points	of	the	movie	and	
deeper analysis	of	a	movie	review	can	tell	us	if	the	movie	in	general	meets	the	expectations	of	
the	reviewer.
Sentiment	 Analysis[1] is	 a	major	 subject	 in	machine	 learning	 which	 aims	 to	 extract	 subjective	
information	from	the	textual	reviews.	The	field	of	sentiment	of	analysis	is	closely	tied	to natural	
language	processing	and	text	mining.	It	can	be	used to determine	the	attitude	of	the	reviewer	
with	respect	to	various	topics or	the	overall	polarity	of	review.	Using	sentiment	analysis,	we	can	
find	the	state	of	mind of	the	reviewer	while	providing	the	review	and	understand	if	the	person	
was	“happy”,	“sad”,	“angry”	and	so	on.	
In	this	project	we	aim	to	use	Sentiment	Analysis	on	a	set	of	movie	reviews	given	by	reviewers	and	
try	to	understand	what	their	overall	reaction	to	the	movie was, i.e. if	they	liked	the	movie	or	they	
hated	it.	We	aim	 to
Classification of movie reviews as POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE
